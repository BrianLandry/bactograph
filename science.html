                <h2>Synthetic Biology</h2>
                <p>Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field that focuses on engineering biological systems to perform nonnative functions by manipulating the transcription and translation of the genetic code.</p>
                <p>The term “synthetic biology” was introduced by Staphane Leduc in 1912. Since then, mankind has sought to engineer life using its knowledge of biology. The development of new technology such as the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize DNA in the 1970s enabled early forms of genetic engineering. The advent of genetic sequencing, nucleotide by nucleotide screening, in the mid-1990s allowed for a more in-depth molecular analysis of genetic constructs. Scientists in the field of systems biology were able to explore the complex interactions between different cellular components in a “top-down” approach. As the comprehensive library of this knowledge grew, they began to systematically design and forward-engineer genetic circuits in a “bottom-up” fashion. By the turn of the century, scientists in the new field of synthetic biology had successfully created circuits that expressed fluorescent proteins in response to extracellular signals. These systems were created using the characteristic engineering design process of model-based design, construction, experimental measurement and analysis, and systematic debugging, techniques still used in the field today.</p>
                <p>Using this approach, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and the University of Texas introduced light-sensitive genes from algae into E. coli and proposed a new image acquisition model, referred to as the Bactograph, pioneering an exciting area of synthetic biology with multiple implications on in-vivo signal processing.</p>

                <h2>Bacterial Photgraphy</h2>
                <p>One application of synthetic biology is creating bacterial photographs using E. coli. In 2005, Anselm Levskaya and others (including Jeff Tabor, now a professor at Rice University) at the University of Texas, Austin utilized a forward engineering approach to program individual E. coli cells (bacteria that natively live in the human gut) to sense light and produce a dark pigment in response, enabling a lawn of bacteria (millions of bacteria spread on a bacterial plate) to take a bacterial “photograph”.</p>
                <p>To accomplish this difficult, distributed computational mechanism, these scientists first re-engineered a native E. coli two-component signaling system to sense the absence of red light, and then attached this sensor to a pigment production module. </p>
                <p>Prokaryotic cells widely utilize two-component systems to regulate gene expression and intracellular activity in response to environmental changes, such as metabolites, mechanical cell wall stress, and even light. A sensor “histidine kinase” detects an input stimulus, and in response, phosphorylates a “response regulator,” which can then affect cellular processes by either promoting or repressing the transcription of specific genes. </p>
                <p>Levskaya et al. created a fusion protein of Cph1, a cyanobacterial (Synechocystis PCC6803) light sensor histidine kinase that senses the absence of red light, and EnvZ, a native E. coli two-component sensing system which responds to cell stress and high salt concentrations. This hybrid protein is called Cph8. In order for the Cph1 photoreceptor to detect photons of light, they also had to introduce a biosynthetic pathway from the same cyanobacteria which uses the genes pcyA and ho1 to produce phycocyanobilin (PCB), a heme derivative, which acts a chromophore. The EnvZ system from E. coli natively phosphorylates the OmpR response regulator, which in turn binds to the OmpF promoter and causes transcription of a downstream gene.</p>
                <p>They linked the output of this system to lacZ, an enzyme that converts a precursor molecule, S-gal, into a black pigment. Thus, they were able to create a genetic “circuit” inside of a single E. coli cell that could respond to light input and produce pigment in response. By propagating this circuit inside of millions of E. coli cells plated on a Petri dish, they could produce bacterial photographs. </p>
                <p>Recent work at the Tabor lab at Rice University has pioneered using light systems to precisely and reliably control genetic transcription inside E. coli. This has been done both with this red light system as well as a new green light sensing system. Furthermore, scientists in the Tabor lab have highly optimized the light sensing systems, creating “optogenetic” tools to further science research. </p>
                <p>The Tabor lab has also reengineered the system and original protocols to cater the experiment to the K-12 classroom environment by replacing expensive aspects of experiment (which originally cost over $15,000 in supplies and equipment) and creating reliable and appropriate K-12 protocols. </p>

                <h2>Current Bactograph Strain</h2>
                <p>The system in this bacterial photography kit still employs the PCB pathway to detect light and the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system to induce a response. However, the lacZ gene has been replaced with a gene called bFMO. The cells currently used to create Bactographs convert tryptophan into indole using the native E. coli gene tnaA. If red light is not detected by the system, OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, which promotes the expression of the bFMO enzyme, which converts indole into indigo, a blue pigment.</p>

                <h2>Bacterial Photography’s Educational Relevance</h2>
                <p>Science is a way of explaining the natural world, so it is important for students to gain an understanding of scientific and engineering practices. Students should develop an understanding of the enterprise of science as a whole: observing, questioning, investigating, data collecting, and analyzing. An emerging field of science, synthetic biology, does just that. Synthetic biology applies engineering principles to biology to create new biological systems. It is redefining the discipline of biology and helping people reach a deeper understanding of how life works.</p>
                <p>Bacterial photography represents a model of combined science and engineering practices and core curricular themes. This importance is stated in the National Research Council Conceptual Framework for New Science Education Standards as follows: </p>
                <p>“Standards and performance expectations that are aligned to the framework must take into account that students cannot fully understand scientific and engineering ideas without engaging in the practices of inquiry and the discourses by which such ideas are developed and refined. At the same time, they cannot learn or show competence in practices except in the context of specific content.” (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 218)</p>
                <p>Bacterial photography helps students engage in the practices of science and engineering. Engaging in scientific practices helps students understand how scientific knowledge develops. Direct involvement gives them an appreciation of the wide range of approaches used to investigate, model, and explain the world. Engaging in the practices of engineering allows students to understand the work of engineers. It makes students’ knowledge more meaningful and embeds it deeper into their worldview. </p>
                <p>The actual application of science and engineering in bacterial photography can stimulate students’ curiosity, capture their interest, and motivate their continued study, all of which will help them recognize that the work of scientists and engineers is a creative endeavor. Students may then recognize that science and engineering can contribute to meeting many of the major challenges that confront society today, including generating sufficient energy, preventing and treating disease, maintaining supplies of fresh water and food, and addressing climate change. </p>
