                <h2>Synthetic Biology</h2>
                <p>Synthetic biology leverages engineering principles to design and construct biological systems at the DNA level for useful purposes. Biology is incredibly prevalent and important. For example, biological processes contribute to health and disease in the human body. Microbes surround our environment, populating nearly every niche on earth. The ability to both understand and engineer biology around us has important applications for nearly every major problem human society faces, such as health, food and energy.</p>

                <h2>Living Machines</h2>
                <p>A core principle of synthetic biology is applying engineering principles to rapidly engineer new organisms with unnatural functions. A NASA engineer could quickly program a space robot by connecting sensors (cameras, temperature sensors, radars) to a computational unit which could process these inputs and then relay appropriate commands to actuators (wheels, robotic arm). Similarly, synthetic biologists seek to engineer individual cells to sense environmental signals, perform computations on these inputs, and respond with appropriate actions.</p>
                <p>A key technology that synthetic biologists utilize is “genetic engineering” tools. These technologies allow scientists to quickly rearrange and assemble DNA sequences — the basic unit of biological information — in new ways. By transferring and creating new DNA sequences that encode novel functions, synthetic biologists can engineer organisms to accomplish completely novel functions.</p>

                <h2>Engineering E. coli to See Light</h2>
                <p>Researchers at the University of Texas (including Jeff Tabor) in 2005 (the early years of the synthetic biology field) were able to engineer Escherichia coli - a laboratory strain of bacteria that normally lives in the dark human gut - to “see light”. First, they transferred DNA sequences encoding sensor proteins from photosynthetic bacteria that live in ponds to the model E. coli. Then, they linked an actuator that produces a dark pigment to these sensors, creating a “bacterial photograph” circuit. By embedding these bacteria in a petri dish, and shining light on them, they showed that these synthetic bacteria could sense and respond to the light, creating a bacterial photograph.</p>
                <p>Jeff Tabor continued work on these light sensors, creating complex circuits with them and characterizing completely new light sensors, and now directs a research lab at Rice University. In 2013, researchers in his lab adapted the bacterial photography protocol from 2005 for the K12 classroom, allowing for the students to complete the highly visual experiment in their own classroom, at low cost.</p>

                <h2>The Bacterial Photography Circuit</h2>
                <p>The bacterial photograph kit consists of an engineered light sensor connected to a pigment production module. The light sensor, consisting of two genes named “Cph8 and OmpR” was engineered as a fusion of a cyanobacteria light sensor two a native E. coli signaling molecule. This signaling pathway is an example of a common prokaryotic signaling pathway called a “Two Component System”. Bacteria use these networks to sense and respond to different environment conditions; a sensor “Histidine Kinase” can sense an input (for example a metabolite, mechanical stress on the cell wall, or even light), and then phosphorylates a corresponding “Response Regulator” which can then effect some type of response in the cell, including transcription of a specific gene.</p>
                <p>In this specific circuit, the Cph8/OmpR two component system is turned on in the dark, and turned off in red light; we have connected the output to a gene that produces indigo (the same pigment that is used to dye your jeans!). Thus, when red light reaches the cells they turn off production of indigo; conversely when the cells are in the dark they turn on indigo. This allows you to reproduce your stencil in bacteria!</p>
